The rental market is constantly changing due to inflation. It is challenging for owners and renters to agree on fair rental prices.  In the short-term, indecision leads to missed opportunities and overpaying for renters.  While for owners pricing too high can lead to additional months where the property is not rented, a lower price may miss the opportunity for increased profits.  This project aims to develop a fair pricing model by mining a large rental data set using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The model will consider many variables, including demographic data, to determine a competitive market price for rental properties.  The model will analyze variables such as location, size, and amenities to provide accurate pricing, giving both owners and renters confidence in their rental decisions.  This will additionally provide the quantitative importance score for individual variables in making the rental decision.  
In addition, investors in the real estate market will be able to use the tool to determine if a property on the market has the potential to have a profitable return on investment.  The project will entail using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and ML techniques, providing a scientifically validated pricing system for the housing market.
